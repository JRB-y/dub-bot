We offer a few varieties of cannabis seeds that you can buy in the shop.
Every seed has:
- a price in $dub.
- a number of feeds after that it can be harvested.
- an estimated quantity of $weed after harvest.

Example:
> **Amnesia Haze** is available in the shop for **50$dub** and can be harvested after **7 feeds**.

By default you have a max slots of 3. You can't have more seeds than your slots (very soon you will be able to buy extra slots from the shop).

When a seed is bought, the growth phase began and cost 200 $dub / plant.
Each plant can be fed only 1 time in 15 minutes.
