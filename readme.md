**DubBot simulate the process of cannabis cultivation**
*You can buy, feed, trade and harvest plants.*

This bot has 2 tokens:

- `$dub`: a currency token for buying seeds and feed plants.
- `$weed`: a Governance token, can be earned when harvest plants not tradable.


We offer a few varieties of cannabis **seeds** that you can buy in the shop.
Every seed has:
-  a price in <span style="color: limegreen;">$dub</span>.
- a number of feeds after that it can be harvested.
- an estimated quantity of <span style="color: limegreen;">$weed</span> after harvest.

Example:
> **Amnesia Haze** is available in the shop for **50$dub** and can be harvested after **7 feeds** and has potential to get between 12 and 20 $weed.


To earn $dub, you need to send messages (don't spam it will not be recorded) 

1 word sent is equal to **1 $dub**.

By default you only have 3 slots. You can't have more seeds than your slots (*slots are coming soon in the shop*).

When a seed is bought, the growth phase began it costs 200 $dub / plant to feed.
Each plant can be fed only 1 time in 15 minutes.
